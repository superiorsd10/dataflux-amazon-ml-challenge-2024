# dataflux Amazon Machine Learning Challenge: Multi-Modal Attribute Extraction

## Overview

This submission presents a comprehensive solution for the Amazon Machine Learning Challenge, focusing on extracting product attributes from images and text. The approach combines advanced natural language processing and computer vision techniques to tackle this complex multi-modal task.

## Technical Architecture

### Data Pipeline

The solution employs a custom `ProductDataset` class, designed for efficient handling of the challenge dataset:

```python
class ProductDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, csv_file, mode='train', limit=None):
        # ... (implementation details)
```

Key features include:
- Flexible CSV parsing with optional row limiting
- Asynchronous image downloading with error handling
- Dynamic switching between training and inference modes

### Model Selection and Implementation

The core of the solution utilizes the `vikhyatk/moondream2` model, a state-of-the-art vision-language model:

```python
model_id = "vikhyatk/moondream2"
revision = "2024-08-26"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id, trust_remote_code=True, revision=revision
)
```

This model architecture enables:
- Seamless integration of image and text inputs
- High-performance visual question answering capabilities

### Inference Process

The inference pipeline is optimized for GPU acceleration and batch processing:

```python
for sample, index in tqdm(test_dataset):
    if sample['image'] is not None:
        try:
            md_answer = model.answer_question(
                model.encode_image(sample['image']),
                sample['question'],
                tokenizer=tokenizer,
            )
        # ... (error handling)
```

### Post-processing Algorithms

A series of sophisticated post-processing steps ensure high-quality predictions for various attribute types:

#### Weight Prediction
```python
def format_prediction(prediction):
    # ... (implementation details)
```
- Utilizes regex for precise extraction of numerical values and units
- Implements comprehensive unit mapping and standardization

#### Voltage Prediction
- Handles various voltage units and formats
- Implements fallback mechanisms for ambiguous cases

#### Wattage Prediction
- Processes complex wattage representations
- Accounts for prefixes (kilo-, milli-) in unit conversion

#### Dimensional Attributes (Width, Height)
- Parses multi-dimensional formats
- Handles implicit units and edge cases

#### Volume Prediction
- Manages compound units (e.g., cubic feet)
- Implements intelligent defaulting for unspecified units

### Result Aggregation

The final stage involves merging predictions from various processing stages:

```python
combined_df = df1.combine_first(df2)
combined_df = combined_df.fillna('')
# ... (additional processing)
```

This ensures a cohesive and standardized output format.
